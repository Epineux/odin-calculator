# odin-calculator
Last project of Odin fundamental. Wanted to make something that looked great and used every aspects of the thing I learned until there. As for Etch a Sketch, its only made for full screen pc. 
Tried to do something more horizontal to fit a computer screen by dividing the calculator in two remotes, one for putting numbers on the screen and one for transforming those numbers (operators and AC/Delete).
Keyboard can taps everything but +-*/ because it was a bit long and not so interesting (as I already made available the others keys for the keyboard). 
Like my buttons animation tho.
